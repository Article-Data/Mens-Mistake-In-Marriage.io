<h1 style="color:Black; font-size:70px; text-align:center;"> <u> Men's Mistake in Marriage </u> </h1>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> <u>Synopsis:</u> This Article is about the mistakes done by Men,<br>Which is the real cause of fight between spouses!
</b> </p>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> We have young boys who have their friends they sit with their friends up to 12:00am at night and 2:00am 
in the morning. After few years when they get married, they still find the same time for their friends.
</p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> THIS IS PROHIBITED! </b>
</p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px; text-align:center;"> <b> How can a person who has now taken somebody's daughter still give preference to his friends over his own wife?</b>
</p> <br>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> Many people give preference to a news paper over their family. Another problem is internet many people spend hours 
on internet and when your family calls you and you say, <b>"I AM BUSY"</b>. </p><br><br>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"> <b> A Brother shared his story with me: </b> </p> 

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> I was married and I was addicted to the internet and i was sitting with the Internet every day, every single day for
6 to 7 hours and I became a person whose social life was the NET and all the friends who were on the Internet and All the people i spoke to were also on the
Internet. I ate and mostly I even asked for the plate of food to come in front of the screen so I would eat whilst i am busy typing, whilst i am busy looking
and so on... <br>
I lost my Wife in the sense that she left me. She deserted me after sometime why because if you are not going to give due attention to your wife who do you want
her to get that from? <b> AND THAT'S A BIG QUESTION! </b>
</p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> Many people are guilty of not spending lighter moments even with their own wives where do they want that Wife to go and
get that from? It is true and we need to talk about it!. Because so many women are suffering in silence it is a fact of life they are too embarassed to mention
what is going on...... <br>
And that is the beginning of the problem imagine the children that come out of such a relationship what warped upbringing will they have what type of a relation
will there be between parent and child, when the parent - parent is nonexistent!!!<br>
So many people are guilty of not understanding that they have taken someone's daughter with the name of Allah!
</p> <br><br>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:50px; text-align:center;">  <b><u>DAUGHTERS</u></b> </p>

<p style="color:Black; font-size:30px;"> Daughters are so special. When you look at your wife don't just look at her as your wife don't just look at her as
your Wife! <br>
She had a more valuable title before and that was, <br><b>SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF SO AND SO,
"Don't make her Cry"</b>
</p><br><br>


<p style="color:Black; font-size:40px; text-align:center;"><b> "If the eyes of a female cry over a man that oppressed her,<br> Angels will curse him with every
steps he walks" <br>
<u>- Ali ibn Abu Talib (R.A)</u>
</b> </p> <br><br>
